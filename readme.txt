Configures New Relic to better track performance, errors, and uptime of WordPress sites, including multisite

== Description ==

Sets the New Relic app name and other configuration values based on WordPress configuration. New Relic profiles code performance and activity, http://newrelic.com .

Separately reports user-facing and dashboard activity, even separates cron and admin-ajax activity to allow different QoS and alert settings for each.

Each blog in a multi-site installation is tracked separately, using the name of the blog as the app name.
